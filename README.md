# Summer Project 2019
My final project for my Masters degree. This took place over the summer of 2019 and I worked from home by myself. This project uses a Javascript backend through the use of a NodeJS server with ExpressJS and an AngularJS front-end with Bootstrap CSS. The database used was MySQL. The application is an online piano store based on the place where I bought my very own piano from and all the pianos' details used in the database were taken from that store. 

How to install the application:
1. Download the code by cloning the repository or downloading the zip folder directly.
2. Create the database by running the database/PianoStore.sql file in a local MySQL server (You will need the MySQL Workbench to do this. You can download this here: https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/)
3. You will need NodeJS commands to run this project so make you install it. It can be downloaded from here: https://nodejs.org/en/
4. To run the application server, open a Terminal/Command Prompt and run the command 'npm start' in the Summer_Project/ directory. Open a second Terminal instance and got to Summer_Project/client/ and run 'npm start' to run the application. Then go to http/:localhost:4200/ on your browser to open the application.

How to use the application:
